# KickPi-OS



KickPi-OS is aimed at Amiga friends who want to revive the Amiga experience on a Raspberry Pi.

Compatible to:

- Amibian Recommended! - (Unofficial addon)
- Raspberry Pi OS 32 bit
- Raspberry Pi OS 64 bit

Software among others:
XFCE4, Amiberry, PiKiss; Comander Pi, Retropie ...
It is a side project of my Amiga 3000 mini to print yourself. But I think it's also interesting for other Amiga friends.

# Disclaimer

The whole thing here is a hobby project. Use at your own risk ;-)
I'm far from being good at scripting ;-) It works.

But: if someone has suggestions for improvement, constructive criticism or whatever - bring them on. A warm welcome

# Supported hardware:

Since it is based on a Raspberry Pi OS, it should work on all Raspbery Pi's.

Please note that the 64 bit version also works, but not all functions are available here.

# Preparation:



Install Raspberry Pi OS using Raspberry Pi Imager
