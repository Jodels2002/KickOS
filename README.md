# KickOS



KickOS is aimed at Amiga friends who want to revive the Amiga experience for Desktop.
The focus of KickOS is easy handling and Workbench like "Look and feel" :-)



It is a side project of my Amiga 3000 mini to print yourself. But I think it's also interesting for other Amiga friends.

# Disclaimer

The whole thing here is a hobby project. Use at your own risk ;-)
I'm far from being good at scripting ;-) It works.

But: if someone has suggestions for improvement, constructive criticism or whatever - bring them on. 
A warm welcome

Greetings Bernd
